Objective - To perform a descriptive analysis of video game market data in order to identify trends, player preferences, and performance drivers that can guide GameCo’s game development and strategic decisions.

Key Questions:

  - Conduct descriptive analysis to uncover overall sales trends and patterns.
  - Examine sales performance across different regions to identify geographic differences.
  - Do some types of games outperform others in popularity and sales?
  - Visualize key insights to support GameCo’s strategic, data-driven decision-making.

Key Insights:

  - North America dominates global video game sales, holding 50–60% share, though sales have declined since the mid-2000s.
  - Europe shows steady long-term growth, increasing from ~30% in 2000 to nearly 40% by 2016, narrowing the gap with North America.
  - Japan peaked in the late 1980s–early 1990s but declined after 1995, stabilizing at around 15% of global sales.
  - In 2016, Shooter, Action, and Sports were the strongest genres across regions.
  - North America & Europe account for 50–80% of sales in Shooter, Sports, and Action genres, while Japan shows relative strength mainly in Action games.

Recommendations:

  - Prioritize Shooter, Action, and Sports genres for new game development due to consistently strong demand.
  - Focus initial market launches in North America and Europe, where sales volume and growth potential are highest.
  - Tailor strategies for Japan by emphasizing Action titles and region-specific preferences.
  - Reduce investment in low-performing genres and reallocate resources toward high-growth segments.
  - Use regional trend data to guide platform selection, marketing spend, and release timing.
